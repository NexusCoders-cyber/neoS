  themes: [
    { theme: 'Education as Liberation', explanation: 'The novel presents education as the key to freeing society from ignorance and corruption.

Education is portrayed as the pathway to national development and individual empowerment.' },
    { theme: 'Tradition vs. Progress', explanation: 'The story explores the tension between preserving cultural traditions and embracing necessary change. While respecting genuine cultural values, the novel criticizes the misuse of "tradition" as an excuse for corruption and resistance to positive change. The Egun festival subplot illustrates how tradition can either enrich or obstruct progress depending on how it is applied. The novel advocates for a balanced approach that preserves valuable traditions while embracing progressive education.' },
    { theme: 'Integrity and Moral Courage', explanation: 'Josiah\'s unwavering commitment to his principles, despite the personal costs, forms the moral heart of the story.

The theme emphasizes that one person\'s principled stand can inspire others and create lasting change.' },

These interconnected problems require a comprehensive approach to reform.' },
  { id: 'lh-exam-2', question: 'What message does Chief Okoro\'s "gift" to Josiah convey about the nature of corruption in the community?', options: { a: 'Corruption is openly discussed and celebrated', b: 'Corruption is disguised as generosity and traditional respect', c: 'There is no corruption in the community', d: 'Only outsiders engage in corruption' }, answer: 'b', explanation: 'The "gift" represents how corruption in the community is often disguised as traditional hospitality and respect. Chief Okoro presents the bribe as a customary gesture, expecting Josiah to understand the implicit expectation of favors in return. This reflects how corruption becomes normalized and embedded in social practices, making it harder to identify and resist.' },
  { id: 'lh-exam-3', question: 'How does Mr. Adesanya\'s character arc reflect the novel\'s theme of moral awakening?', options: { a: 'He remains cynical throughout the story', b: 'He transforms from a fearful cynic to an active supporter of reform', c: 'He betrays Josiah to the chief', d: 'He leaves the school at the beginning' }, answer: 'b', explanation: 'Mr. Adesanya\'s journey from a cynical, fearful teacher to an active supporter of Josiah\'s reforms represents the novel\'s theme of moral awakening.

  { id: 'lh-exam-5', question: 'In the context of the novel, what does the contrast between the school compound and Chief Okoro\'s compound symbolize?', options: { a: 'The importance of agriculture', b: 'Social inequality and misplaced community priorities', c: 'Modern architecture styles', d: 'The beauty of traditional design' }, answer: 'b', explanation: 'The stark contrast between the dilapidated school and Chief Okoro\'s elaborate compound symbolizes the social inequality and misplaced priorities in the community. While education - the foundation for future development - is neglected, personal wealth is accumulated and displayed. This visual contrast reinforces the novel\'s critique of a society that fails to invest in its most important institution: education.' },
  { id: 'lh-exam-6', question: 'How does the novel portray the relationship between education and national development?', options: { a: 'Education has no connection to national development', b: 'Only technical education matters for development', c: 'Quality education with integrity is essential for building a better nation', d: 'Foreign education is the only path to development' }, answer: 'c', explanation: 'The novel presents education as the cornerstone of national development, but emphasizes that it must be quality education delivered with integrity. Josiah\'s belief that educated children will build a better Nigeria drives his every action. The novel argues that compromised education produces compromised citizens, while principled education creates principled leaders who can transform society.' },

When parents withdraw their children from school for festival activities, it creates a concrete conflict that forces characters to choose between cultural practices and educational advancement. The novel uses this to explore how tradition can be either preserved harmoniously with education or used as an excuse to neglect it.' },
  { id: 'lh-exam-8', question: 'What does Chukwuemeka\'s sense of entitlement reveal about the effects of corruption on younger generations?', options: { a: 'Young people naturally resist corruption', b: 'Corruption breeds a culture of entitlement and undermines merit-based systems', c: 'Children are not affected by adult corruption', d: 'Entitlement only affects the wealthy' }, answer: 'b', explanation: 'Chukwuemeka\'s expectation of special treatment because of his uncle\'s position reveals how corruption perpetuates itself across generations. When young people grow up seeing that connections and bribes trump hard work and merit, they develop a sense of entitlement that undermines any merit-based system. The novel shows that corruption doesn\'t just affect individual transactions but corrupts the very values that society transmits to its youth.' },
  { id: 'lh-exam-9', question: 'How does Pastor Emmanuel\'s eventual support of Josiah enhance the novel\'s message about moral leadership?', options: { a: 'It shows religious leaders should stay out of educational matters', b: 'It demonstrates that moral leaders must eventually choose sides in the struggle between right and wrong', c: 'It suggests only religious people can be moral', d: 'It implies politics and religion should merge' }, answer: 'b', explanation: 'Pastor Emmanuel\'s journey from neutrality to active support illustrates that moral leaders cannot remain neutral indefinitely in the face of clear wrongdoing. His eventual stand with Josiah suggests that those who claim moral authority must ultimately act on their principles. The novel implies that silence and neutrality, while safe, are forms of complicity that moral leaders must eventually reject.' },
  { id: 'lh-exam-10', question: 'What significance does Adaeze\'s character have in the novel\'s exploration of the personal costs of principled stands?', options: { a: 'She is merely a background character with no real significance', b: 'She represents the family members who share the risks and burdens of those who fight for principles', c: 'She opposes Josiah\'s reforms throughout', d: 'She is the main antagonist' }, answer: 'b', explanation: 'Adaeze\'s character is crucial in showing that principled stands affect not just the individual but their entire family. Her concerns about safety, her moments of fear, and her unwavering support despite those fears show the real human cost of standing up against corruption. Through her, the novel acknowledges that moral courage often requires the support and shared sacrifice of loved ones.' },
  { id: 'lh-exam-11', question: 'What does the novel suggest about the role of community witnesses like Mazi Okonkwo in fighting corruption?', options: { a: 'Elderly people are irrelevant to social change', b: 'The silent majority can become powerful agents of change once inspired to speak up', c: 'Only young people can fight corruption', d: 'Community members should always stay neutral' }, answer: 'b', explanation: 'Through Mazi Okonkwo and other community members who eventually support Josiah, the novel suggests that the silent majority holds significant power. When these normally quiet voices are inspired to speak up, they can shift the balance against corruption. The novel implies that often people are waiting for someone to give them permission or courage to voice what they already know to be right.' },
  { id: 'lh-exam-12', question: 'How does the novel\'s ending balance realism with hope?', options: { a: 'It presents a completely happy ending with no complications', b: 'Josiah faces real consequences but his stand creates lasting positive change', c: 'Everyone who opposed Josiah is punished severely', d: 'The ending is entirely pessimistic with no hope' }, answer: 'b', explanation: 'The novel\'s bittersweet ending is carefully balanced to be both realistic and hopeful. Josiah does face personal costs for his stand - the novel doesn\'t pretend that fighting corruption is without sacrifice. However, his courage plants seeds of change that will bear fruit over time. This realistic hopefulness suggests that meaningful change is possible but requires patience, sacrifice, and sustained commitment.' },
  { id: 'lh-exam-13', question: 'What does Mrs. Folake Bello\'s widowhood add to her significance as a character supporting education?', options: { a: 'It is an irrelevant detail about her background', b: 'It shows that even the most vulnerable members of society can be powerful advocates for change', c: 'It suggests only widows should support education', d: 'It indicates she is unimportant to the plot' }, answer: 'b', explanation: 'Mrs. Bello\'s status as a widow makes her support for Josiah even more significant because she has no husband to protect or support her. Her willingness to publicly support educational reform despite her vulnerable social position demonstrates that courage isn\'t determined by power or protection. She represents how even society\'s most vulnerable members can be powerful agents of change when they believe in a cause.' },
  { id: 'lh-exam-14', question: 'What does the novel imply about the relationship between individual integrity and institutional reform?', options: { a: 'Institutions can reform themselves without individual leadership', b: 'Individual integrity is the foundation upon which institutional reform must be built', c: 'Only external forces can reform institutions', d: 'Integrity is irrelevant to institutional change' }, answer: 'b', explanation: 'The novel strongly implies that institutional reform begins with individual integrity. Josiah alone cannot transform the entire educational system, but his personal commitment to doing what is right creates the conditions for broader change.
